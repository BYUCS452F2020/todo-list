Response to Pitch

I'm interested in this project for a few reasons. I like to keep myself organized 
by filling in my tasks, jobs, homework, etc. in
todo lists. The idea in this todolist that really appeals to me is that the todo items will have 
more than just "todo" and "complete". Having various states could kick this project up a notch.

I also like the idea of using MongoDB, because I am familiar with it, but I want to get better at it.
I think that the document based DB is something that everyone should know, so more practice with this
will be beneficial to me and goals for learning.

Lastly, I like to be organized and this is another way to help me in that endeavor.
