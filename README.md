# Todo List
The purpose of this project is to showcase database modeling concepts through the creation of a simple todo list. Some of
the entities we will create include: users, todo_items, and todo_item_states. A user will be able to log in to the service,
create todo items, and move those items into various states.

## Team
Looking for one other person to work on this project with me.

## SQL
PostgreSQL

## NoSQL
Document based NoSQL DB. MongoDB is the preference with Mongoose framework.

## Business
This is an educationally motivated project and therefore will be open source and will result in no cost to the membership.
 However, if the user-base grows to a significant size where financing the project is cumbersome we will result to a donation
  model to help finance the continued hosting of the application.
